A bad excuse is better than none
A bad workman blames his tools
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Actions speak louder than words
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A lie has no legs
A penny saved is a penny earned
A room without books is a body without soul
Actions speak louder than words
All good things come to an end
All roads lead to Rome
All that glitters is not gold
All that lives must die passing through nature to eternity
All is fair in love and war
All is well that ends well
Among the blind one eyed man is a king
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cur
Apology is politeness too late
As you make your bed so you must lie upon it
Ask a silly question and you get a silly answer
Bad news travels fast
Beauty is only skin deep
Be to yourself as you would to your friend
Better late than never
Boys will be boys
Clothes do not make the man
Constant dropping wears away a stone
Curiosity killed the cat
Dont burn your bridges behind you
Dont count your chickens before they are hatched
Dont cry over spilt milk
Dont look a gift horse in the mouth
Dont make a mountain out of a molehill
Dont put all your eggs in one basket
Duty is what we expect from others
Early bird catches the worm
East or West home is best
Every cloud has a silver lining
Faith will move mountains
First come first served
Fortune favours the brave
Forbidden fruit is sweetest
Fortune is fickle
Friend to all is a friend to none
Friendship is like money easier made than kept
Half a loaf is better than none
Haste makes waste
He who excuses himself accuses himself
He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword
History repeats itself
Honesty is the best policy
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver
It is a wise talker who knows when he has nothing to say
It is never late to learn
It never rains but it pours
It is easy to be wise after the event
Let sleeping dogs lie
Make hay while the sun shines
My house is my castle
Necessity is the mother of invention
Nothing venture nothing gain
Once bitten twice shy
One swallow doesnt make a summer
Opportunity makes a thief
Practice makes perfect
Prevention is better than cure
Rome was not built in a day
The appetite grows with what it feeds on
The devil is not so black as he is painted
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
There is no accounting for tastes
Time is a great healer
Too many cooks spoil the broth
When in Rome do as the Romans do
When the cat is away the mice will play
Where there is a will there is a way
